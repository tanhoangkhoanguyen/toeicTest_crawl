Can we add some activities such as camping expeditions or something?\n9:21 Lawrence O'Donnell: \nI don't know if I'll be able to attend this time. My group is finishing up a major project. Camping sounds great though.\n9:22 Patricia Noble (moderator): \nCamping is a good idea but it'll take more time to plan. We'll definitely keep this in mind for the next workshop.\n9:24 Jimmy Rhee: \nI don't think videos are very effective. How about getting more speakers to present? I'd rather interact with someone.\n9:27 Monica Choi: \nI'm looking forward to the camping idea. But for this workshop, I agree with Jimmy. Videos can be quite boring.\n9:30 Jared Davis: \nI noticed that John Olive is not presenting this time. What happened? He was very popular.

Ge Xi has had a lot of experience as a supervisor in China and she always has some interesting stories.\n10:01 Jimmy Rhee: \nI second that. I would certainly like to hear what Ge Xi presents. And speaking of cultural perspectives, Adam has had experience managing employees in a number of countries. He'd be interesting I think.\n10:09 Isabella Price: \nYes, let's get Adam to present in the workshop.\n10:15 Adam Cruz: \nWow, I'm flattered by your vote of confidence. I certainly wouldn't mind participating in the workshop. I'm free in the afternoons.\n10:19 Patricia Noble (moderator): \nThank you Adam.

The goal of this program is to support local efforts to sustain a convenient and satisfying life in the countryside. The grants available this year are as follows:\nBusiness Development Grant: $250,000\nCommunity Development Grant: $150,000\nCommunications Development Grant: $200,000\nEducational Development Grant: $100,000\nThe institute will give priority to proposals that reflect a comprehensive approach to community development, promote community engagement, and make rural communities a better place to live and work. The grants will allow rural communities to take the first step toward a project or plan that can help improve the lives of rural community members. For the past decades, the grants have been used for a variety of purposes such as state-of-the-art farming equipment, road maintenance, communications infrastructure, educational facilities, and investments for young rural entrepreneurs.\nDownload this \napplication\n to apply for a grant. The deadline for submission is February 28. \nVillage of Cranton Wins Funding\nCRANTON, March 22-The Institute of Rural Service announced today that the village of Cranton is this year's recipient of the Educational Development Grant. The grant will be used to fund the construction of a large playground that will provide recreational activities for children under 12. Since the opening of the new electronics factory last year, the number of families in the area has risen dramatically. As a result, children have been left with less and less space to play in. The new playground will allow children to play and enjoy themselves when they are not at school.\nCranton is proud to be the recipient of this grant and plans to apply for more grants in the future to improve the living conditions of the town and attract more residents.",

I received your e-mail about the payment for my upcoming stay at the hotel. However, I would like to inquire about extending my stay for an extra night. I recently heard that there will be a local food festival held on October 16 and I would like to attend it. Therefore, I would like to stay at your hotel until October 15. Please let me know a revised room fee so that I can make the correct payment as soon as possible.\nJake Baldwin\n-------------------------\nTo:\n Jake Baldwin (baldwinj@technet.com)\nFrom:\n Amy Lee (alee@dreamoasishotel.com)\nDate:\n September 24\nSubject: \nThe 15th\nDear Mr. Baldwin,\nYou are right to be excited about the food festival that will be held on the October 16th. Unfortunately, this event has become so popular that the city fills up for that weekend. I regret to inform you that there is no vacancy at the Dream Oasis Hotel for the night of the 15th. I went ahead and looked into some of our partner hotels in the area, but those properties also are at full occupancy. I do hope you are able to find someplace to stay in the city so you can enjoy the festival while you are in town; I just wish it could have been with us. You could try the Executive Inn in Fairview; it is a large hotel and they do have vacancies.\nSincere apologies,\nAmy Lee\nCustomer Service Manager\nDream Oasis Hotel",
