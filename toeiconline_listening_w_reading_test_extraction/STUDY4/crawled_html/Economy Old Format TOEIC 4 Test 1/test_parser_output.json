Admission is free for anybody who holds a ticket to the canceled Michaels show, or $10 for everybody else. \nA nice touch: The band will donate the door money to Michaels' favorite charity, the American Diabetes Association. The musicians are calling it the Antidote Show. \nAlso, for fans of \"Asia\", western New York promoter Billy Pilo has his own show planned. \"Asia\" plays at 7 p.m. on Saturday at the Main Street Armory, 78 Main St. , Rochester.

I recently started a new job as the administrative director for a nonprofit agency that, like most organizations and businesses, cannot function without a computer. This morning when I arrived at work, my Apex Dimension 5000 would not boot up properly. After \nexhausting \nmy own fairly extensive knowledge about how to get a misbehaving computer to work properly, and consulting my agency's tech department in vain, I called Apex PC Technical Support. \nGary, the tech support professional who answered my call, spent two hours on the phone with me, walking me through processes ranging from diagnostics to rebooting in various command prompt modes. Gary was wonderful to work with. I was delighted to be on the phone with someone whose knowledge, respect, and sense of humor (particularly important, in my opinion, when dealing with potential computer disasters) made this ordeal much less challenging. \nAlthough your automated answering system is frustrating-I got many \"I'm sorry, I don't understand\" responses although I speak quite clear and articulate English, and I got cut off at one point - I very much appreciate the excellent customer service your human staff members give. As a result of the help I got today, I elected to extend our Gold Service Contract so that if I have such a problem again, I will have access to your staff. \nAgain, thank you. \nSincerely, \nMark Matthews",

Results are analyzed, especially the comments section, to identify possible process improvements or areas in the agency which need increased education or marketing efforts. Program areas use the information to review and implement any necessary program/process changes that will benefit customers or save money. Previous survey results have led to significant improvements to TWDB's programs. \nThe Tennessee Water Development board intends to use this information to improve its products and service delivery and to increase customer education and awareness regarding agency products and services. \nSurvey Results: 2010 Customer Survey \nThe most frequently cited suggestions for improvement included: \n- Increasing personal contact with customers \n- Increasing interdepartmental and interagency cooperation \n- Further improving the agency's websites \n- Improving the scope and accuracy of information provided \n- Increasing funding opportunities. \nResult\n: In summary, customers rated TWDB highly, with 94. 8% of all respondents giving the agency an excellent (52. 8%) or good (42.0%) rating. Furthermore, the specific departments evaluated consistently received satisfaction ratings of at least 96%. A detailed report of the results will be posted on the company website in two weeks.",

Last year's Faculty Institute opened by considering a number of quality \"elements\" for teaching with technology. We broadly surveyed examples of how faculty, educational services, and technology support staff are addressing each of these standards, in addition to methods of surveying students to receive feedback. This year we will add to these elements to expand the scope of our faculty members. \nUniversity College will provide travel support for faculty attending the 2011 Faculty Institute as part of our commitment to assure quality distance education. If you will be traveling from UMPI, UMFK, or UMM, this includes hotel accommodation for the evening of May 17 in addition to the mileage reimbursement provided for faculty from all UMS campuses. As always, we encourage carpooling.

I am now a human resources recruiter at Intel Learning. My work at Intel Learning is interesting. The company culture is a lot like the culture at Academia Scholastic. \nI noticed your ad for a sales manager at classifiedjobs.com. We have a young intern here named Brie Claudia who will be completing her internship with us at the end of next month. I would love to be able to hire her full time, but Intel Learning currently has no openings due to budget cuts. Ms. Claudia has taken on increasing responsibilities since hare arrival at Intel Learning, and she has become a reliable and trustworthy manager. I'd really like to see her find work at a company that utilizes her diverse skills. \nI truly believe Ms. Claudia meets all the qualifications for the position you advertised. Let me know if you are interested in interviewing her and I will have her forward her resume. \nBest regards, \nAshley Park",
