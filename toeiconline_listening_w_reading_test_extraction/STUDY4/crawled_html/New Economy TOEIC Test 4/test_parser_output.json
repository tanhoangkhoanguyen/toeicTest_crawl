Maybe one day I'll find a dog that I really want.\" -[4]-\nBecause of the success, the Blakes are considering expanding by purchasing the adjacent shops. \"We need more space to fit all our customers and the animals,\" explained Kevin. \"It can get very crowded at times.\" The Blakes are looking to renovate the dog caf\u00e9 next month and the cat caf\u00e9 during the fall.",

Our seamstresses will get to work on those today.\nBill Flake \n(9:42)\nThen do you think the project will be completed by this Friday as the Manillo's wanted?\nLucy Mitt\n (9:43)\nI'm not sure. It'll depend on when the lace arrives. Our group can start sewing some of the pieces together, but we need the lace to complete the intricate designs.\nBill Flake\n (9:44)\nCan you contact Hand-Made Lace and find out when the shipment arrives?\nLucy Mitt \n(9:45)\nActually, Richard is taking care of that. Any word from them, Richard?\nRichard Choi \n(9:45)\nYes, I just got off the phone with them. There was a bit of a delay because the lace artisans used the wrong silks. They had to re-work the lace. We'll receive them this afternoon. They sent a rush delivery to us.\nBill Flake\n (9:46)\nExcellent. Then can the drapes be finished at the end of this week?\nLucy Mitt\n (9:47)\nNo problem. We'll work around the clock to get them finished on time.\nBill Flake\n (9:48)\nI'm glad to hear that. They are long-time customers and they needed the drapes for their new condo this weekend.",

Hospital Director Zack Chambers, who was recently presented with an Outstanding Leader Award from the National Health Care Alliance, started the program to create stronger connections between the hospital and the community. Mr. Chambers encourages adults of all types and occupations to apply even if they don't feel completely qualified. Simply visit the Clearwater Hospital website and become a member of the hospital free of charge.\n\"I hope through this program, volunteers can form close relationships with patients to help them get through these difficult times in their lives,\" said Mr. Chambers. He also hopes that the program will lead to more people visiting terminally ill patients in person.\nClearwater Hospital\n-------------------------\nMay 4\nMonica Greene\n4100 Washington Road\nScranton, Wisconsin 54481\nDear Ms. Greene,\nI was delighted to receive your letter. I am very excited to have been paired with you as pen pals. I hope we can learn a lot from each other and build a lasting friendship.\nAs you know, I live in California, which is a long way from Wisconsin. I hope that in the coming months I can find some time off work and visit you. Please let me know when the most convenient time would be for me to meet you.\nI look forward to hearing from you,\nJessica Wright\n-------------------------\nDear Jessica,\nYou don't know how much I appreciate your kind words. Although the staff at Clearwater are very kind, I feel the need to connect with people who are not part of the staff. My surviving family also live a great distance away, in Florida, and so most of the time I am just communicating with the paid staff or the other patients. I would welcome a visit, if you truly wanted to come, and the best time would be for our meeting is the Thanksgiving holiday party here at the center I suppose. My own family might be here as well. If it is too much for you, or if you can't get the time off of work, don't worry about it too much. I do hope that we can continue to communicate through our letters.\nAll the best,\nMonica Greene",

With over 3 million members nationwide, our franchise has become known as a reputable and trustworthy brand. Our success is a result of great relationships between us the franchiser and our franchisees.\nYou are receiving this mailing because you expressed interest in partnering with 24/7 Fitness in order to open a new location in your town. According to our preliminary research, your town has a large population of young, single people working in the professional field. This is our target demographic, and it means the business outlook for your 24/7 Fitness location is positive in your town. If you would like more information about the specific terms and regulations when partnering with 24/7 Fitness, please don't hesitate to call me at 347-555-3363. Additionally, if you would like to talk to another franchise owner, that information can be supplied by one of our associates.\nSincerely,\nLori Swanson\nChief Operating Officer\n-------------------------\nTo: \nZack Carter (zcarter@zenmail.com)\nFrom: \nJohn Morris (jmorris@cbnet.com)\nSubject: \n24/7 Fitness\nDate:\n March 6\nDear Mr. Carter,\nMy name is John Morris and I am a small business owner living in the Millville area. I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions.\nI am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.\nSincerely,\nJohn Morris\n-------------------------\nTo:\n John Morris (jmorris@cbnet.com)\nFrom: \nZack Carter (zcarter@zenmail.com)\nSubject:\n 24/7 Fitness\nDate: \nMarch 7\nDear Mr. Morris,\nI am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser.\nLet me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team!\nAll the best,\nZack Carter",

I am currently scouting for a warehouse in the Pittsburg area. As you know, having an effective distribution strategy is critical for every company in today's fast-paced business world.\nTherefore, I am looking for a warehouse located in the outskirts of Pittsburg. The warehouse needs to be located close to the highway. We are shipping a high volume of products, so we would prefer a dedicated warehouse to be used exclusively for Turner Electronics operations. A warehouse with a spacious loading bay for large trucks is necessary. Additionally, a warehouse that also has office space would be ideal. Because of the valuable nature of our products, we would like a warehouse that provides precautions against theft and damage.\nI look forward to hearing your response soon.\nSteven Mason\nTurner Electronics\n-------------------------\nTo: \nSteven Mason (smason@turnerelectronics.com)\nFrom:\n Kevin Scott (kevinscott@startrealty.com)\nDate:\n February 3\nSubject:\n Re: A warehouse\nDear Mr. Mason,\nIt seems that as your company expands, you would like to improve the operations of your distribution network and deliver products to sellers more quickly. We have a variety of warehouse options, and I trust one of them will fit your company's needs. All locations have a state-of-the-art security system as well as experienced staff.\nLocation 1-$3,499 per month for a 10,000-square-foot warehouse space shared by multiple businesses. Because this location is a shared operations site, we offer it at a discounted price.\nLocation 2-$5,500 per month for an older warehouse located in downtown Pittsburg. This warehouse is currently empty, and therefore can be used by your company exclusively. It also features a walk-in freezer.\nLocation 3-$6,500 per month for a very spacious warehouse located a few miles outside of Pittsburg. Although currently used by two other businesses as a storage space, it can be converted into a warehouse only for your company.\nLocation 4-$2,600 per month for a medium-size warehouse. This warehouse is provided at a discounted price because it has no area for trucks to unload cargo conveniently. It is best for smaller-sized operations.\nThese are the locations currently available for use. If you have any questions or would like to visit a location in person, please contact me.\nKevin Scott\n-------------------------\nTo: \nKevin Scott (kevinscott@startrealty.com)\nFrom: \nSteven Mason (smason@turnerelectronics.com)\nDate: \nFebruary 3\nSubject:\n Location 3\nDear Mr. Scott,\nThank you so much for responding to my inquiry so quickly. Although none of the warehouses is exactly what I was looking for, I think the best option for our business will be Location 3. This, of course, is contingent on the other two businesses moving their storage into another warehouse. Our operations, as I noted in my first e-mail, are expanding, and I want to make sure that we have ample room to grow. I am delighted that there is security at your warehouses as well.\nI have some time early next week if it would be possible to take a walk through Location 3. I think once I get a feel for the space, I will be able to make a firm decision. Please contact me by phone at your convenience so we can set up a time.\nYou can reach me at (351) 546-9899.\nAll the best,\nSteve Mason\nTurner Electronics",
