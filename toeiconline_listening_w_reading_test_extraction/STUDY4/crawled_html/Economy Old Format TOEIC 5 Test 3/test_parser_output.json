Most of the customers evaluated Fresh Freesia as too weak.\nThey felt that the fragrance evaporated within an hour and recommended that we add more durability to the scent.\n2. Many customers rated the product designs as attractive.\n3. The most popular scent was Sweet Sensation and the least was Luscious Lilac.\nWe will be holding a meeting to talk over the survey results, more specifically on improving the Fresh Freesia.\nThe specific time and place for the meeting will be made known by my secretary soon.",
