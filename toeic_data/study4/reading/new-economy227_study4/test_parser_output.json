Maybe one day I'll find a dog that I really want.\" -[4]-\nBecause of the success, the Blakes are considering expanding by purchasing the adjacent shops. \"We need more space to fit all our customers and the animals,\" explained Kevin. \"It can get very crowded at times.\" The Blakes are looking to renovate the dog caf\u00e9 next month and the cat caf\u00e9 during the fall.",

I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions.\nI am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.\nSincerely,\nJohn Morris\n-------------------------\nTo:\n John Morris (jmorris@cbnet.com)\nFrom: \nZack Carter (zcarter@zenmail.com)\nSubject:\n 24/7 Fitness\nDate: \nMarch 7\nDear Mr. Morris,\nI am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser.\nLet me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team!\nAll the best,\nZack Carter",

I am currently scouting for a warehouse in the Pittsburg area. As you know, having an effective distribution strategy is critical for every company in today's fast-paced business world.\nTherefore, I am looking for a warehouse located in the outskirts of Pittsburg. The warehouse needs to be located close to the highway. We are shipping a high volume of products, so we would prefer a dedicated warehouse to be used exclusively for Turner Electronics operations. A warehouse with a spacious loading bay for large trucks is necessary. Additionally, a warehouse that also has office space would be ideal. Because of the valuable nature of our products, we would like a warehouse that provides precautions against theft and damage.\nI look forward to hearing your response soon.\nSteven Mason\nTurner Electronics\n-------------------------\nTo: \nSteven Mason (smason@turnerelectronics.com)\nFrom:\n Kevin Scott (kevinscott@startrealty.com)\nDate:\n February 3\nSubject:\n Re: A warehouse\nDear Mr. Mason,\nIt seems that as your company expands, you would like to improve the operations of your distribution network and deliver products to sellers more quickly. We have a variety of warehouse options, and I trust one of them will fit your company's needs. All locations have a state-of-the-art security system as well as experienced staff.\nLocation 1-$3,499 per month for a 10,000-square-foot warehouse space shared by multiple businesses. Because this location is a shared operations site, we offer it at a discounted price.\nLocation 2-$5,500 per month for an older warehouse located in downtown Pittsburg. This warehouse is currently empty, and therefore can be used by your company exclusively. It also features a walk-in freezer.\nLocation 3-$6,500 per month for a very spacious warehouse located a few miles outside of Pittsburg. Although currently used by two other businesses as a storage space, it can be converted into a warehouse only for your company.\nLocation 4-$2,600 per month for a medium-size warehouse. This warehouse is provided at a discounted price because it has no area for trucks to unload cargo conveniently. It is best for smaller-sized operations.\nThese are the locations currently available for use. If you have any questions or would like to visit a location in person, please contact me.\nKevin Scott\n-------------------------\nTo: \nKevin Scott (kevinscott@startrealty.com)\nFrom: \nSteven Mason (smason@turnerelectronics.com)\nDate: \nFebruary 3\nSubject:\n Location 3\nDear Mr. Scott,\nThank you so much for responding to my inquiry so quickly. Although none of the warehouses is exactly what I was looking for, I think the best option for our business will be Location 3. This, of course, is contingent on the other two businesses moving their storage into another warehouse. Our operations, as I noted in my first e-mail, are expanding, and I want to make sure that we have ample room to grow. I am delighted that there is security at your warehouses as well.\nI have some time early next week if it would be possible to take a walk through Location 3. I think once I get a feel for the space, I will be able to make a firm decision. Please contact me by phone at your convenience so we can set up a time.\nYou can reach me at (351) 546-9899.\nAll the best,\nSteve Mason\nTurner Electronics",
