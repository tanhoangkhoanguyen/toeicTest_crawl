I think you'll be pleased with the final results. I also wanted your insights for a prospective business trip to the Czech Republic. I've tentatively scheduled a meeting with reps from SW Bank, but I've yet to set a firm date or plan any of the details. Terrance tells me you visited the CR a few years back, so I would welcome any suggestions you might have. Send me an email when you get a chance. Thanks. Carl \nTo\n: Carl Kerry\nFrom\n: Tuan Plau\nDate\n: March 5\nRE\n: Travel advice Carl, I'm still enjoying the sights of Santa Domingo. We're putting the finishing touches on the contract here, and I should be on a plane headed home very shortly. I'm ecstatic the Brunson deal is complete. I was starting to get worried with the long delay. I was so anxious about the details after your e-mail, I had my assistant send me a brief summary of the details. Carl, as usual, your insights were right on the money. Great job! I had a phenomenal time during my visit to the Czech Republic. It's a very beautiful country. During peak tourist periods it gets pretty hectic, though. If you go in July or August, those are the months when school is out there and the number of visitors is very high. I would suggest you go in either April or October. That\u2019s when the sightseeing season is slow, and you can enjoy a peaceful atmosphere. I highly recommend setting up a quiet business meeting at a restaurant nearby Prague Castle. In the absence of lots of tourists it\u2019s an ideal atmosphere to conduct a productive meeting. When I went two years ago, it was towards the end of winter, and I took the opportunity to explore the white slopes of the Czech mountains. It was unbelievable. I highly recommend any of the ski resorts during the winter, but be aware the temperatures are always below zero. Call me if you have any questions, and again great work on the Brunson deal. Tuan",

I received my first dry cleaning delivery yesterday morning, and I was very satisfied with your work. Unfortunately, when I checked my credit card statement online, I saw that I was charged a $6. 99 next-day delivery charge last week when I opened my account, the customer service representative assured me that I would receive free delivery for any orders placed with the $70 promotional credit. I was also informed that under the terms of the No Customer Left Unsatisfied Guarantee Garment One-Day would provide an additional credit in case of any erroneous charges. Thus, I\u2019m requesting that you erase the delivery charge of $6. 99 and credit my account the guarantee. Thank you. Tim Carhartt",

            "context": "To\n: Overtures ASP Division Employees\nDate\n: June 3, 2010\nSubject\n: Name Change for ASP Division of Overtures Effective immediately, the ASP Divisions of Overtures are adopting new internal names. The three divisions will be known collectively as Overtures Partner Solutions, and each division name is changing as follows. 1. The ASP Insurance Division will be called \nInsurance Solutions\n. 2. ASP Pharmacy Services will change its name to \nPharmacy Solutions\n. 3. Our catalog business will become C\nonsumer Health Products\n. We're making this change because, at times, the placement of ASP in our division names has caused confusion for external audiences. This change will clarify to regulators, policymakers and other businesses that we are part of Overtures and, while we serve ASP members, we do not work directly for ASI or ASP. The name change also strengthens our ties to Overtures and helps support the Overtures brand. As Overtures \nembarks\n on company-wide initiatives to accelerate growth, we will continue to be a critical part and vital source for that success. Please begin using the new names immediately for internal and corporate communication. More details will follow as we develop a new layout for business cards and letterhead using the Overtures logo. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Jesse Torres at 855-541-2164.",
