I've heard about your fantastic restaurant and I and my wife are actually planning to visit your restaurant soon. Today I write this letter to you to tell you about our great deals on fish. Our crew only goes out to the sea early in the morning so that the fish will continue to stay fresh throughout the whole day and that's where we got our name 'Fresh Fish'. Here are some of the deals that I wanted to offer you:\nAs you see, this is unusually cheaper than normal price, and I wish you do not miss this chance to make a great profit. Our tunas and salmons are outstanding in their quality, and I am pretty sure you've heard of our yellow tail and crab for their great taste. Please contact me as soon as you decide and we will ship it to your restaurant in less than 10 hours. Thank you.",

What can do about it?\n\"When we do it together\", Mr. Peterson, the head of the National Nature Conservation Association says, \"we can protect them, and eventually protect ourselves\", Mr. Peterson and his colleagues proposed selecting one representative from each city to come together and find solutions that they can carry out all together.\n\"It you have passion for life, life that has always made this world as beautiful as it was, and courage to act upon what you believe, please come and help us\". Mr. Peterson said with great inspiration. This movement called \"Protect Us\" is a nationwide movement and (we) are looking for sponsors and support from anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Just call 1-800-SAVE-US to support financially or sign up to be a representative for your city.

Last night when I was watching T. V. at home, I was very inspired by your short message that my desire to support you and your group led me to write this letter to you. I remember when I was young my dad would always take me fishing and hunting, experiencing the beauty and power of nature. I surely want that to continue for my children and also for all of our future generations. I would like to donate $1, 000 dollars and actually become an official sponsor of National Nature Conservation Association. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help, other than supporting financially. I applaud your courage and passion to save what God has given us.\nJames O'Conner\nCEO & President of New Electronics\nBloomberg, NY",

This and other results of the National sleep Center decade-long study of the effects of sleep deprivation on adults were announced yesterday at a press conference by Margaret Norwood, the research scientist who headed the study. Dr. Norwood stressed that \"getting adequate sleep is not a luxury, it is critical to proper brain functioning. People who sleep well show greatly enhanced moods, improved memories, and better job performances and are significantly less likely to be involved in accidents.\"\nDr. Hugh Weatley, the director at the center, agree, stating that, while individuals do vary in their need for sleep, \"most adults require one hour of sleep for every two hours of wakefulness\". He suggested that individuals determine their own requirements by sleeping for the amount of time they think they need for a week.",
