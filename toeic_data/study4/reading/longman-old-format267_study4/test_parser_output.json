People who sleep well show greatly enhanced moods, improved memories, and better job performances and are significantly less likely to be involved in accidents.\"\nDr. Hugh Weatley, the director at the center, agree, stating that, while individuals do vary in their need for sleep, \"most adults require one hour of sleep for every two hours of wakefulness\".

I've heard about your fantastic restaurant and I and my wife are actually planning to visit your restaurant soon. Today I write this letter to you to tell you about our great deals on fish. Our crew only goes out to the sea early in the morning so that the fish will continue to stay fresh throughout the whole day and that's where we got our name 'Fresh Fish'. Here are some of the deals that I wanted to offer you:\nAs you see, this is unusually cheaper than normal price, and I wish you do not miss this chance to make a great profit. Our tunas and salmons are outstanding in their quality, and I am pretty sure you've heard of our yellow tail and crab for their great taste. Please contact me as soon as you decide and we will ship it to your restaurant in less than 10 hours. Thank you.",
