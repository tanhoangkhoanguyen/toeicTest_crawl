JM Solutions would be happy to offer you our services.\nAs I said on the phone, we will help design and program a website that will attract more customers and offer an online sales platform. During this time, we will need to hold meetings with your marketing division in order to best capture your company's goals. Once the website has been completed in mid-February next year, we will hold a training seminar in order to train your employees in the skills necessary to maintain and update your website. The website development and training seminar will cost a total of $32,000. We request that a deposit of 10% be paid in advance. Please see the attached file for detailed costs and schedules.\nWe look forward to working with you in the near future. Our staff members will strive to meet all your needs. Therefore, just let me know when your marketing division is available to meet us in person and discuss some of the details of the project. Please contact me at your convenience.\nEric West\n-------------------------\nTo: \nLillian Ross (lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com)\nFrom:\n Raymond Wells (raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com)\nDate:\n November 4, 10:37 AM.\nSubject:\n First Quarter Budget\nAttachment:\n Q1_Budget\nDear Ms. Ross,\nI have attached the current draft for the company's budget for the first quarter of next year. As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year's back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement.\nAt our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already include employee raise in the first quarter's expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know. I would like to have the budget finalized before next week's planning meeting.\nRaymond Wells\n-------------------------\nTo:\n Raymond Wells (raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com)\nFrom: \nLillian Ross (lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com)\nDate:\n November 4, 10:40 AM\nSubject:\n Emergency Budget Addition\nDear Mr. Wells,\nI am glad you forwarded me your proposed budget when you did. Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Although the final bill of $32,000 is not due immediately, we will have to find an extra $3,200 in next year's first quarter budget if we want to proceed with JM Solutions' proposal.\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please just come to my office and we can go over where we can make the tough cuts to come up with this funding.",

Therefore, you will be charged an overdraft fee of $30.00. This may have resulted from an accumulation of account withdrawals that were in process at the time you withdrew money from the ATM. We regret to have to make this charge whenever a member's debit card transactions exceed his or her funds.\nIn the future, this mistake can be avoided by signing up for our Stark Bank mobile banking service. This service only costs $2 a month. Using your smartphone, you can access your accounts no matter where you are. You can check the amount of money in your accounts, your history of deposits and withdrawals, and most importantly, pending transactions. To sign up, please e-mail us at customerservice@starkbank.com or call us at 904-555-4514.\n-------------------------\nTo:\n Customer Service (customerservice@starkbank.com)\nFrom:\n Suzie Summers (ssummers8zippynet.com)\nSubject:\n Overdraft Fee\nDate:\n June 5\nI am concerned that someone may have illegally accessed my account and made a withdrawal. I lost my debit card on June 2, and upon noticing the next day, I immediately froze all of my accounts. Considering these unfortunate circumstances, I politely ask that the bank refrain from charging the fee for this unforeseen overdraft.\nI would like to sign up for the banking service you recommended. It sounds like a useful service that can help me manage my finances in a more efficient manner.\nThank you for your assistance.\nSuzie Summers\n-------------------------\nTo:\n Suzie Summers (ssummers@zippynet.com)\nFrom:\n Customer Service (customerservice@starkbank.com)\nSubject: \nOverdraft Review\nDate: \nJune 6\nDear Ms. Summers,\nI am sorry to hear of your misfortunes. According to our account data, we see that you did contact us and freeze your accounts, though it looks like it was too late to prevent the withdrawal and subsequent overdraft of your account. It is a little bit unusual that the transaction that caused the overdraft was at an ATM machine a day after you say that you lost your card. Have you given your access pin to anybody recently? I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you. Once we receive this number, we can proceed with our review of your case.\nThank you and good day,\nLaura Massey,\nCustomer Service Specialist,\nStark Bank",

He assumed the position of CEO at the company-based in Dallas, Texas-just this Monday.

He once served as head of the American League of Business Leaders and is a dedicated family man.\n---------------------------\nTo:\n Steve Cross (scross@techlife.com)\nFrom:\n Lynn Dyer (ldyer@techlife.com)\nSubject:\n Welcome!\nDate:\n April 15\nDear Mr. Cross,\nIt has been almost two years since we met. I am so glad to be collaborating with you again after we worked in the same department at Esta Resources. I felt we cooperated very well at that time, and I had been hoping to work with you again. You will find that we have very dedicated and hard-working teams here. If there is anything I can do to help you make the transition, please don't hesitate to ask.\nAdditionally, Tech Life has recently added five new managers to our company. If you have time, please visit them when they will all be attending a mandatory training session at 3:00 P.M. this afternoon in Room 403.\nSincerely,\nLynn Dyer\nDirector of Human Resources\nTech Life",

            "context": "Normanville Farmers' Market\nApril 9\nDear Normanville Resident,\nThis year's first Normanville Farmers' Market will be open on Saturday, April 14, on Clark Street, between Main Street and Park Street. The farmers' market will be available between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. The mayor of Normanville, Tom Daley, will be present to deliver an address at the opening ceremony. A lot of local farmers, food vendors, and street performers will be at the venue.\n\"This vibrant market will give our local farmers a nice place to sell their fresh produce. Additionally, because we cut out some middle processes, our prices are lower than those of average grocery stores,\" said Suzy Hammer, executive director of the Normanville Farmers' Association.\nMs. Hammer also mentioned that currently there is not enough parking space to accommodate shoppers. The Normanville Farmers' Association plans on expanding parking space in the coming months after the market has opened this Saturday. In the meantime, she advises Normanville residents who will visit the market to use public transportation in order to avoid parking difficulties.\nThe Normanville Farmers' Market is different from other grocery stores that supply mass-produced food products. The market will provide organic produce that is full of essential vitamins and minerals. As you know, the market will also help the local economy.\nPlease come this Saturday and see what the Normanville Farmers' Market has to offer!\nSincerely,\nNormanville Farmers' Association",

Collections will be made twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays from the regional recycling center, which will be supplying colored receptacles for different kinds of waste. All oils should be placed in the green container. All metals and glass belong in the red one. All paper waste should go into the blue one. Plastics will be collected for recycling as normal.\nAs this new policy also carries a financial benefit to the company, managers in all manufacturing bays are responsible for ensuring that the new protocols for waste disposal are followed, and failure to comply with the policy could result in disciplinary action.\nFurther information about our updated environmental practices will shortly be available on the website. Training sessions for managers will be held on Monday, October 22, but please contact me if you have any further questions in the meantime.\nRegards,\nDavis Jeeland\nOperations Director, Unsworthy Manufacturing",
