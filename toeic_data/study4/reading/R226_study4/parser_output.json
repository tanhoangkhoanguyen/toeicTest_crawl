I recently heard that there will be a local food festival held on October 16 and I would like to attend it. Therefore, I would like to stay at your hotel until October 15.

Unfortunately, this event has become so popular that the city fills up for that weekend. I regret to inform you that there is no vacancy at the Dream Oasis Hotel for the night of the 15th. I went ahead and looked into some of our partner hotels in the area, but those properties also are at full occupancy. I do hope you are able to find someplace to stay in the city so you can enjoy the festival while you are in town; I just wish it could have been with us. You could try the Executive Inn in Fairview; it is a large hotel and they do have vacancies.\nSincere apologies,\nAmy Lee\nCustomer Service Manager\nDream Oasis Hotel",

The grants will allow rural communities to take the first step toward a project or plan that can help improve the lives of rural community members. For the past decades, the grants have been used for a variety of purposes such as state-of-the-art farming equipment, road maintenance, communications infrastructure, educational facilities, and investments for young rural entrepreneurs.\nDownload this \napplication\n to apply for a grant. The deadline for submission is February 28. \nVillage of Cranton Wins Funding\nCRANTON, March 22-The Institute of Rural Service announced today that the village of Cranton is this year's recipient of the Educational Development Grant. The grant will be used to fund the construction of a large playground that will provide recreational activities for children under 12. Since the opening of the new electronics factory last year, the number of families in the area has risen dramatically. As a result, children have been left with less and less space to play in. The new playground will allow children to play and enjoy themselves when they are not at school.\nCranton is proud to be the recipient of this grant and plans to apply for more grants in the future to improve the living conditions of the town and attract more residents.",

Can we add some activities such as camping expeditions or something?\n9:21 Lawrence O'Donnell: \nI don't know if I'll be able to attend this time. My group is finishing up a major project. Camping sounds great though.\n9:22 Patricia Noble (moderator): \nCamping is a good idea but it'll take more time to plan. We'll definitely keep this in mind for the next workshop.\n9:24 Jimmy Rhee: \nI don't think videos are very effective. How about getting more speakers to present? I'd rather interact with someone.\n9:27 Monica Choi: \nI'm looking forward to the camping idea. But for this workshop, I agree with Jimmy. Videos can be quite boring.\n9:30 Jared Davis: \nI noticed that John Olive is not presenting this time. What happened? He was very popular. I'd like to attend his workshop.\n9:41 Patricia Noble (moderator): \nJohn hasn't confirmed with us yet because he may have conflicting schedules. He's trying to work around his schedule.\n9:52 Isabella Price: \nI'd like to attend John's workshop as well. I noticed that there are still a couple of empty slots. Would anyone be interested in hearing Ge Xi? I'd love to get a different cultural aspect.\n9:58 Jared Davis: \nGreat idea! Ge Xi has had a lot of experience as a supervisor in China and she always has some interesting stories.\n10:01 Jimmy Rhee: \nI second that. I would certainly like to hear what Ge Xi presents. And speaking of cultural perspectives, Adam has had experience managing employees in a number of countries. He'd be interesting I think.\n10:09 Isabella Price: \nYes, let's get Adam to present in the workshop.\n10:15 Adam Cruz: \nWow, I'm flattered by your vote of confidence. I certainly wouldn't mind participating in the workshop. I'm free in the afternoons.\n10:19 Patricia Noble (moderator): \nThank you Adam. I'll put you down for the 3:00-4:00 P.M. slot if that's OK with you.\n10:30 Adam Cruz: \nThat sounds great. And could you send me a guideline if you have one?",

The whole premise of the idea came up after Rachel and Robert Burnelle had their first child. Both working parents had constantly turned to fastfood for their meals and realized that many of their friends did as well. They wanted healthier options which most fast-food franchises don't provide. -[2]- The business is so popular that they have been getting orders from outside the city. \"The response has been overwhelming,\" says Rachel. \"Our customers especially appreciate the freshness and quality of our meals.\" Janet, a customer from the start added, \"Not only is the food healthy, it's not that much more expensive than fast-food meals, but it's much better for you.\" -[3]-\nThe Burnelles say they are planning to expand their delivery routes and open three Farm-to-Table grocery shops with ready-made meals around the city of Grandview within the next year. -[4]-",
