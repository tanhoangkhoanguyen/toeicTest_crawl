I was told by the concert hall manager that a hall will be available on the 4th, 8th and 21st of the next month. I didn't give him a final answer because I wasn't sure how much time you need to rehearse. \nAs you know, this will be one of the most important concerts for your band, as it's the first one since the release of your last album two years ago. Since you've decided to perform more concerts than make another album, this first concert should really be something special. \nPersonally, I thought that the 8th would be the best as long as it gives you enough time to rehearse. I think the 4th would be a little too early. The 21st would be okay, but I'm just not sure because Marine Force is putting on the concert on the 23rd. Thus, I think that would take away some people who would go to your concert. \nGet back to me as soon as possible so I can finalize the schedule with the concert hall staff. Thanks. \nDave \nThe hottest news in the music industry lately is the Han's first concert in two years. Two years ago, Han's, one of the most popular rock bands, expressed its intention to focus on concerts instead of recording any new albums. After two years, fans are finally able to see them again. However, critics are expressing a few concerns about the band. \nFirstly, Why hasn't a band performed for the past two years? Two years seem like a long time for their fans. \nSecondly, while Han's has been off radar, other new bands such as Marine Force have quickly risen to the top of the charts. More importantly, Han's and Marine Force will be performing only two days apart. This will cause an \ninevitable\n competition between the two top bands. \nAs much as fans have been waiting for Han's concert, it better satisfy fans' expectations in order to keep them away from Marine Force.",

It featured an electronic dictionary and an MP3 player. I spoke to the salesperson, whose name is a Michael Robertson, at length about my needs and told him that I was interested in durability rather than functions. He said he carried the DMP4 for $500 and the DMP5 for $600. I knew that DMP4 was renowned for its durability. Mr. Robinson assured me that the DMP5 had recently come out with more functions and would hold up as well, if not better than the DMP4. \nOn Mr. Robertson's recommendation, I purchased the DMP5 and, upon receipt, he informed me that should I have a problem with it, I could exchange it for a new model as long as it was in the original packaging. Since GNet Inc. is not based locally, it would take too long to transport it to and from the maintenance department at your headquarters for processing. To save time, the retailer where I purchased the item said he would exchange it for a new one and send it back himself. \nHowever, after one of use, I found the protective cover has been ineffective in protecting it from other objects in my bag, which caused the initial programming and operating problems. When explaining this to Mr. Robertson, he stated that I am not entitled to an exchange and should contact the company directly. Since the DMP5 was purchased on your retailer's recommendation, I would like to ask for an exchange. \nI'd greatly appreciate it if this issue could be rectified immediately. \nSincerely, \nKim Severson",

However, we are unable to sign this contract immediately, as final approval of expenditures of this nature must come from the accounting department.

            "context": "Oil spills at sea threaten animal life, plant life and other marine resources. Oil can also cause long-term environmental and economic damage to marine ecosystems near a spill. There are several ways to tackle oil spills at sea. The best method is to collect the oil and physically recover it from the water. However, the mechanical recovery of oil is not feasible in rough weather conditions. Secondly, the cost of oil cleanups by mechanical means is high when compared to chemical cleanup methods. \nToday, the chemical dispersion of oil is one of the most favored ways to deal with offshore oil pollution. These chemicals contain surface active agents in a solvent base which are absorbed at the oil/water interface and lower interfacial tension. This facilitates the production of small oil droplets into the water column. Oil dispersed effectively into a larger volume of seawater is rapidly diluted by turbulence and its concentration is reduced soon to background levels. \nConcern that chemical dispersants could be toxic to marine life has led to considerable caution in authorizing their use at spill sites. The newest generation of dispersants is less acutely toxic than earlier products, though misuse can lead to environmental hazards. Secondly, our dispersants satisfy the efficiency, stability and toxicity criteria and have received approval from the government.

            "context": "To:\n All directors\nFrom: \nReed Abelson\nDate: \nSeptember 19\nSubject:\n Directors' meeting agenda \nDear Directors, \nIn response to changing publication trends, I offer the following agenda to discuss at the directors' meeting next Monday. \nOur sales department reports that sale of the Fishing Monthly in print edition have been drastically declining over the past couple of years and have actually dropped by 40% this year. Since print publication rates are diminishing and electronic publication rates and rising, we also have to consider turning our sights on electronic publication. \nThere is statistical evidence that electronic publishing provides wider dissemination, and a number of journals have already established electronic versions or even moved entirely to electronic publication. Electronic publication will cut down production and shipping costs and attract more readers at a reduced price and with better accessibility. In addition, the government offers subsidies for green publishing to companies which adopt a publishing process to minimize the impact on the environment by using digital or print- on- demand technology. \nGiven these facts, I'd like us to start thinking about ways to promote Fishing Monthly's online edition and reduce the print edition by at least 50% next year. In order to cut down on print publishing, we might have to shut down some of our production plants. This surely is not an easy decision. However, given the current bus business climate, I feel these changes are absolutely essential to succeed in the coming year and beyond. \nI look forward to discussing this and other issues involving the magazine with all of you on Monday. \nReed.",
