We will reserve a room that can be closed off or opened up to match the final number of people. We have all the audio-visual systems available for you to use, so just please let us know if you need anything.\nWe wanted to confirm with you that you will not need any catering. However, if you end up changing your mind, please let us know before November 15, so that we can call and make an arrangement with a catering company.\nI have included the total estimated price for your three days long conference. Please call me for any questions or concerns. Again, I appreciate you choosing Wise Conference Center.

However, there are several questions that I wanted to ask you. I was wondering if the Wise Conference Center has any fitness room, swimming pool, or spa etc. , for us to enjoy, how big the cafeteria is, how many people are sharing one room, and if there are any nice parks for families to enjoy. Also. I have a few disabled people that will be coming to our conference, and I was wondering if your conference center has adequate facilities for those people so that they are as comfortable as possible. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\nJoel Passon\nDiscovery Corporation\nConference & Seminar Manager\nPass@discover. com",

I've received two issues so far and I think they're really great. You still subscribe to the magazine, right? I was wondering if you wanted to subscribe to Electronic Gaming Monthly with me. I saw an ad for it in GamePro. The reason I'm asking you to subscribe to it together is because the subscription fee is quite high, and I thought it might be better to share the subscription with you, since we are both fans of gaming. Write back ASAP!\nThanks",

            "context": "Bad News for Our Economy\nExperts Forecast a Rapid Recession during Second Half of the Year\nApril 6th, 2006\nMany forecasting experts have announced that they have determined a recession in progress, with its cycle peak estimated to be in October 2006. The recession could be set in motion by a decline in consumer purchasing, since consumers are becoming more sensible about what they buy. A more likely cause would be failure of economic growth. However, these are causes speculated by the public. Andrew Bushee, an expert at Anderson Center at the University of California, outlines three main reasons for the recession visible on the horizon. He lists the recent power crisis, inflation concerns, and significant global trade imbalances. At a press conference last week, he announced that a tight financial budget for the next year will be required to overcome the recession. Top on the list of government priorities, according to this budget plan, should be allocating more time and effort to sectors of the economy which will be most effective in stimulating economic growth and development. According to the econometric model used by certain forecasters, the probability of a looming recession is as high as 90%. So far, a dwindling GDP, hiking unemployment, reduced investment, and job cuts have been predicted.\nJOB CUT ANNOUNCEMENT\nDue to the recent recession in economy, we are announcing a cut of an additional 500 jobs over the next two years. The job cut will just be a part of our restructuring plan. Losing more than 10 percent or our work force will be an aspect of the plan that is essential in order to reduce costs and become more efficient in our operating margin.\nIn addition to cutting a number of employees, we ask remaining employees to take salary cuts and trim expenses \nto the bone\n. Because the economy is in poor shape now, and our company is suffering as a result, we need more than ever to be in decent financial shape.\nThank you.",

Some of you have already mentioned that various components are hard to obtain from the usual sources. We have looked into the matter, and it turns out the main reason we are experiencing difficulty with our usual sources is because our competitor, Fenway Automobiles, has recently offered them a much more lucrative contract. It is important that we obtain the needed items soon, through finding new suppliers. Unless we do so, we may not be able to meet our holiday deadline. As you all know, the demand for new automobiles goes up at the end of the year, and we want to make sure we meet the demand for cars on time.\nIt is no secret that Fenway Automobiles has been giving us a good run for our money. I believe that this holiday season is our chance to rise above the competition and find a firm, unshakable foothold in the industry.\nTherefore, it is crucial that everyone attend this meeting. Also, I would appreciate it if you came with any ideas concerning useful strategies against Fenway Automobiles. If you have any additional questions or suggestions, be sure to contact me or my secretary.\nTo: \nJames Rotner\nFrom: \nRachel Cooper\nDate:\n November 29th. 2006\nSubject:\n [RE]: Meeting to discuss shortage of automobile parts\nI am sorry but I don't think I will be able to attend the meeting you called this afternoon because I have a doctor's appointment at 2:30. However, I know someone who may be able to get into contact with new suppliers if we should need them. Although these suppliers seem to want a higher price, it will probably be hard to find other suppliers willing to work together so late in the year. I will get back to you after collecting more information.",

In fact, my motto had been that customer service is mediocre at best. I am glad to say that DBX Studio proved me wrong and my web site is clear proof of that!\nWhen I first talked to Douglas, one of your associates, on the phone, I knew he was the right web designer for me even though we had never met or spoken before. I was impressed most with Douglas' commitment to my work and his willingness to educate me about the web design process.\nThroughout my experience with DBX Studio I was always very satisfied with prompt and reliable service. Douglas told me that I could reach him at almost anytime. Now this is unheard of, and it is a great example of the kind of personal customer service today's businesses should strive for. I remember times when Douglas told me he would be working until 1 am or so on my web site to meet our deadlines. And sure enough, I would receive emails the next morning that were received anywhere from 1 to 3 am.\nThank you so much for all of your help - the web site looks terrific! I look forward to referring many of my clients to you.\nSincerely,\nScott Hatheaway\nPresident of Speedenix",

One area where people have not been fully cooperating is in regard to office supplies. For this reason the following guidelines are being put in place:\nDave Smith has been designated as in charge of all supplies. All supplies must be checked through him with your Signature and his before they are removed from the storeroom.\nThere are monthly limits to how much of each item can be borrowed each month. Anything exceeding these amounts must be approved by your manager and Dave Smith, and the justification must be given in writing.\nAlong with these guidelines,\nHere are some additional suggestions with regard to conservation of these materials:\nHang on to your pens! We go through far too many pens in this office. This can only be because people are carelessly losing them.\nPeople should always print on both sides of office paper before recycling. Unless this is for official business correspondence.\nFolders and binders can be used again once old projects are completed. The cost of these items adds up!\nI appreciate your cooperation, and I hope these measures will lead to an improvement in this area soon.",
