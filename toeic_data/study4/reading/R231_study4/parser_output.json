            "context": "A new trend in agriculture: organic goods\nAs North America and Europe grew through the Industrial Revolution, their agriculture sector has completely transformed small-sized farms to commercialized, large-scale ones that cultivate massive amounts of crops.\nSmall farmers across the world can rarely compete against industrialized farms.\nSuch commercialization instigated mega-sized agribusinesses to employ reckless means, such as using excessive amount of pesticides, to expand their business.\nIn the 1980s, just over 150 agribusinesses produced crops that feed the whole North American and European population.\nHowever, small-sized farms are coming back because of the increased concern modern society has about industrialized crop production.\nAs more and more people look for organic farm produce, local farmers are taking their proximity to consumers as an advantage in selling organic crops.\nThese farmers have started to maximize their profit by creating networks among themselves and using them to create small stores within a community.\nBy marketing the stores' proximity and healthiness, they are able to rake in a lucrative profit.\nLarge agribusinesses were able to supply their products to almost every supermarket they could find.\nBut because small organic stores have limited space, their capacity to carry a variety of food products or supply them to other grocery stores is difficult.\nThis is why many organic stores are opening websites for online shopping.\nOnce an order is registered online, farmers can prepare the product right at their farms and deliver it to customers instead of doing so at their small, crowded stores.\nThis service has proved to be popular, as working moms are able to shop for healthy food products conveniently at home.\nRegarding the cost of not using pesticides, most organic farmers are relying on traditional methods that work well.\nFurthermore, most of the traditional methods are recognized by environmental organizations as safe for the environment.\nMany governments, understanding the advantages of small, organic farming, are publicly supporting it by building relevant institutions, sending out experts and campaigning.",

Most of the customers evaluated Fresh Freesia as too weak.\nThey felt that the fragrance evaporated within an hour and recommended that we add more durability to the scent.\n2. Many customers rated the product designs as attractive.\n3. The most popular scent was Sweet Sensation and the least was Luscious Lilac.\nWe will be holding a meeting to talk over the survey results, more specifically on improving the Fresh Freesia.\nThe specific time and place for the meeting will be made known by my secretary soon.",
