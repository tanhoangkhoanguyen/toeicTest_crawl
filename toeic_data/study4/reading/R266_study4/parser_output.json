I started a checklist to make sure we keep track of what our potential customers want. New Prints sent me an e-mail yesterday requesting 100 brochures and a display stand. (Are the brochures back from the Make Ads yet?) Inside Photo asked me this morning to get a sales rep to call. All the representatives are at a meeting and won't be able to return calls until Feb 5, next Monday. However, I will talk to the reps manager to see if they can finish their project earlier to talk to our clients.\nFrom: \nAaron Prince\nTo:\n Namsu Jeong\nSubject: \nRE: Requests for information\nDate: \nFri, Feb 2, 2006 17:35\nToday, I received requests for brochures from Marvel Film, Digital Zip, and Media Top.

Unfortunately, the brochures won't be ready until next week. This afternoon, I'll fax a promotional flyer to each of them and tell them the brochures will be sent on Feb 6th.

The Honors College is pleased to offer you an opportunity to learn more about Honors College membership. You are invited to attend one of the Honors College introductory sessions noted below:\nJanuary 23 - Monday - 129 Shody Hall - 4:30-5:30 pm\nJanuary 24 - Tuesday - C106 Colmes Hall - 4:30-5:30 pm\nFirst-year students may apply for membership in the Honors College during their second semester if they maintain at least a 3. 5 G. P. A. and expect to reach sophomore standing by the end of the semester. If you are interested in applying after attending one of these sessions, you will schedule a time to meet with an Honors College adviser in Eustace-Cole Hall.\nIf you cannot attend any session, you can make an appointment BEGINNING JANUARY 30 with an Honors College adviser by using the on-line scheduling system.\nHenry D. Cogner\nDean, The Honors College E-mail: cogner@asu.edu\nTo: \nHenry Cogner\nFrom: \nJimmy Dashes\nSubject: \nRE: Honors College Information Sessions\nDear Prof. Henry Cogner,\nMy name is Jimmy Dashes and I am a freshman in Arizona State University. Even before coming into ASU, I've heard great things about the Honors College and one of the goals that I've set this year was to get into the Honors College. But I feel that I've had to come a long way to even apply for the Honors College. My family's business has been going down ever since we moved to Arizona and last semester, I didn't get the money for the scholarship I earned, which was going to be used for my tuitions. So I had to work 12 hours a day every day for two months from September to November. Then at the end of November, before the final exam period, I got into a car accident, and I had to spend one week in the hospital.\nMy current G. P. A. after the first semester is 3. 3. And I know that the G. P. A. has to be over 3. 5 to be eligible to apply for the Honors College. However, I plead with you Prof. Cogner that you consider my situation and how it was inevitable for me to do not as well as I could and not get over 3. 5 G. P. A. I thank you for your time and attention, Prof. Cogner.\nSincerely,\nJimmy Dashes\nASU freshman",

Unfortunately, we must decline this request. We understand your desire to include everyone, and we wish we could accommodate those teams which are unable to attend on the originally scheduled date. However, there has been too much work done to promote the event for the originally scheduled date. Also, Wiggly Field has already been reserved for May 30, and there is a steep penalty to be paid for changing the date.\nBest Regards,\nJimbo Jones",

As you are aware, our program offers the chance for your children to have many exciting experiences, both here at our facility, and at other locations in and around the city where we occasionally go on field trips. These field trips include visits to museums, amusement parks, trips to swimming pools, as well as nature walks, for which we have guides who are knowledgeable in the local animal and plant life. We make a serious effort to make everyday at camp fun and educational.\nYour letter to us stated that you have three children, which means that you are eligible for our special group discount.\nThe cost per child for the month for a single child is $599, but with three or more children, the cost is only $509, a 15 percent saving! This means you will need to pay the low total price of $1, 527 for your entire family to attend the camp. Also, if your children have other friends who wish to attend the camp, they can enjoy the same savings if you book them all at once.\nWe look forward to your confirmation, and we look forward to seeing your wonderful kids here at Sassy Children's Day Camp.\nSincerely,\nJesse James\nJesse James, Director\nSassy Children's Day Camp",
